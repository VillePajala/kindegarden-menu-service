# Kindegarden menu service
An RPA process to fetch the menu of a kindergarden from web.

### Prerequisite tools:
* UiPath Studio
* Google Chrome

### Modifications to tools:
 * In order to make downloading of files work, Chrome's settings must be changed to ask download location. Settings -> Advanced -> Ask where to save each file before downloading -> On
 
 ### Process map
 * (a gliffy flow chart will be added later)
